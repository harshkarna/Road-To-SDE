/*
You are given 2 numbers (n , m); the task is to find nâˆšm (nth root of m).


        Example 1:

        Input: n = 2, m = 9
        Output: 3
        Explanation: 32 = 9
        Example 2:

        Input: n = 3, m = 9
        Output: -1
        Explanation: 3rd root of 9 is not
        integer.
