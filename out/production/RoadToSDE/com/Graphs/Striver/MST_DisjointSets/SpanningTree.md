A spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph while satisfying two conditions:

It must be a tree, meaning there are no cycles or loops in the subgraph.
It must span all the vertices, which means that every vertex in the original graph is connected to at least one edge in the subgraph.
In other words, a spanning tree is a connected acyclic subgraph that covers all the vertices of the original graph.

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a spanning tree of an edge-weighted graph that has the minimum possible total weight among all possible spanning trees. In an edge-weighted graph, each edge is assigned a weight or cost. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of the weights of its edges.

The concept of minimum spanning tree is commonly used in network design, where the goal is to connect a set of nodes with the minimum total cost. By finding the minimum spanning tree of a network graph, we can identify the subset of edges that form the most cost-effective way to connect all the nodes.

There are several algorithms to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph, including Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm. These algorithms iteratively add edges to the spanning tree while ensuring that no cycles are formed and the total weight is minimized. The resulting tree is the minimum spanning tree of the graph.
